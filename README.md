# Meal registration
This app is created for my personal convenience.
Since I currently am on a low carb diet, I need to count both carbs and calories,
carbs to determine the amount of insulin I need to use before the meal and calories to not over-eat.

The features that are to be implemented:
* Adding and editing meals and foods
* Using previously entered foods and including them in the meal
* Add food automatically when it is not yet in the database

# Prerequisites
* PHP 7.2
* sqlite3
